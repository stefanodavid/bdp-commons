bdp-api
=================

This is the *codebase for each internal developed webservice* exposing the big data platform API. This module contains the API of the bdp, means it exposes data as json which it get's from the reader (https://github.com/idm-suedtirol/bdp-core/tree/master/reader). Which also means that alone this module gives you nothing.
For **each typology** of data we create **a specific module/webservice** which exposes the data which is meant to be shown.
e.g. for all data regarding Parking slots we deploy a module which only exposes data relative to the parking domain like capacity or current occupancy of a parking slots.

Each typology of data is **identified by the stationtype**, which can also have child stations. It only goes down **one level**, which means a child station can not have childs on it's own. Like for example a carsharingstation(the place where you take the car) has multiple children which are the single cars(CarsharingCar)

## Configuration
For it to work you just need to fill out the configuration file you find under `src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/application.properties`
There you basically do 2 things:
1. Point the module to the reader which was setup previously

		[Default]
		host=localhost
		port=8080
		ssl=false
		endpoint=/reader
2. Define your stationtype and childstationtype and define under which path your children-station will be provided
		bdp.stationtype=EChargingStation
		bdp.childstationtype=EChargingPlug
		bdp.childrenpath=hello
	If no  children exist for specific station just leave the 2 child fields empty

Each module(and also each stationtype) will have the same api-structure. If you go to the root site of your app you will find swagger documentation about the API. Generally all api calls will be available under

		[app]/rest/

 and each all api calls for the child stations(which are the same api calls) will be available under

 		[app]/rest/${bdp.childrenpath}/

The available stationtypes and childstationtypes are:

| Stationtype   	|      Childstationtype | Childstationpath | Endpoint
|----------	|:-------------:|--- | ----------
| BikesharingStation | Bicycle | bikes | bikesharing
| Bluetoothstation | / | / | bluetooth
| Carpoolinghub | / | / | [put on hold]
| Carpoolingservice | / | / | [put on hold]
| CarpoolingUser | / | / | [put on hold]
| Carsharingstation | Carsharingcar | cars | carsharing
| EChargingStation | EChargingPlug | plugs | emobility
| Environmentstation | / | / | environment
| Linkstation | / | / | origin-destination 
| Meteostation | / | / | meteorology
| Mobilestation | / | / | [not-needed]
| ParkingStation | / | / | parking
| RWISstation | / | / | roadweather
| Streetstation | / | / | street
| TrafficSensor | / | / | sensors
| Trafficstation | / | / | [not-needed]

TODO: Further development will provide this mapping through the reader API which should make it dynamic and maintainable

## Building & Deployment

Once you finished the configuration steps the building should be handled by maven easily. Just go to the root directory and:

		mvn clean test package

You will find your war artifact in the target director and you can deploy it to an application server of your choice.
